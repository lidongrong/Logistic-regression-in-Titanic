# Logistic-regression-in-Titanic

2018年秋季学期伯克利交换 Linear Modeling(STAT 151A)作业，素材为 Kaggle 竞赛题

这一程序用于对泰坦尼克号乘客建模，使用 logistic 回归判断泰坦尼克号上的某位成员能否生存。数据集来自https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

该模型在测试集上的预测准确率大约为86%

尚有不完善之处，将来可能进行改进

This is the homework of Linear Modeling(STAT 151A) during my exchange to UC Berkeley in fall 2018. The material of the program comes from Kaggle.

This program models passengers on titanic, predicts if they could survive based on various factors. The dataset comes from https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data. 

The model's performance on the testing set has an accuracy rate of about 0.86

Still there is improvement shall be made to this model.
